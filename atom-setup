Install go in your system.

Set GOPATH and PATH in system.
If using ATOM & Ubuntu

~/.profile: If you set them here, $GOPATH will be set in Atom when you launch Atom for the first time from the launcher in the toolbar
~/.bashrc If you set them here, $GOPATH will be set in Atom when you launch Atom for the first time from the terminal
Thus, to ensure GOPATH and PATH are set correctly regardless of how you launch Atom, you should put the following (or similar) in both ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc:

export GOPATH=$HOME/work
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH

Packages of Atom:
     go-plus
     platformio-ide-terminal
